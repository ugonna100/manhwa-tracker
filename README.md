4. Git clone this repo: 

5. Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
    This is a program that contains python and handles creating environments for it. It'll make handling packages a lot simpler.
    If you're already familiar with python, just use whatever you want.

6. Create an environment using Python 3.8 using this command: `conda create --name name_goes_here python=3.8`
    For many extra commands: use the conda cheat sheet: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf
    Download it for better size.
